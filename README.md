wat?

This is a reimplementation of the C reimplementation of the original Node.js implementation
of my inebriated IRC chatbot.

I'm new with this C++ stuff, be gentle! This code so far isn't as advanced as the C implementation,
but is completely memory-safe (for now) and is much more concise (thank you, C++). It has multiple failures,
including the addition of duplicates, that must be corrected, and many things I'd still like to add.


Consider this Ã¼ber-alpha.
